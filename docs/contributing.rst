How to contribute
******************

We want to encourage users and developers to give active feedback on their experience and feel free to contribute. 

First, we feel very strongly about being inclusive and respectful to other contributors. 
Please follow the `Python Community guidelines <https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/>`_ if you wish to contribute to our project.

There are different ways you can contribute:

User feedback
==============
We would like to hear about your experience when using ImSwitch and suggestions for improvement. You can do that by starting a thread in the `discussion section <https://github.com/kasasxav/ImSwitch/discussions/>`_ of the repository. 

Improving documentation
========================
We would like to include your use-case into the documentation!
Feel free to open a discussion thread about what you wish to include or improve.

Reporting bugs
===============
If you experience a bug, you can directly report it in the `issues section <https://github.com/kasasxav/ImSwitch/issues/>`_ and add a bug label. Describe how to reproduce the bug and as much information as possible to fix it more efficiently. 

Have you written a code that fixes the bug? You can open a new pull request or write your suggestion in Discussions.

Suggest a new feature 
======================
If you are missing features and want to develop ImSwitch further, you can start a discussion and brainstorm your suggestions. Feel free to open a pull request, but we believe it’s essential to have feedback from the community if you want to add new functionality.

Adding device support
======================
For adding support to new devices, we encourage you to follow the software architecture diagram provided in the `paper <https://github.com/kasasxav/ImSwitch/blob/master/paper/paper.md>`_ and create the necessary classes (driver, device manager, etc.). You can start a discussion if you want to get advice and help to get started.

Automated tests
================
We want to keep including automated tests into the development process, so if you have contributed to the project by fixing a bug or providing new functionality, we encourage you to write code that tests your contribution as well.
