Hardware Control Configuration
******************************

Hardware control configurations are to be placed in the /config/imcontrol_setups/ directory. You
can also find some pre-made configuration files there.


Detector managers
=================

HamamatsuManager
----------------

DetectorManager that deals with the Hamamatsu parameters and frame extraction for a Hamamatsu
camera.

Available manager properties:

- cameraListIndex -- the camera's index in the Hamamatsu camera list (list indexing starts at 0); set this to an invalid value, e.g. the string "mock" to load a mocker
- hamamatsu -- dictionary of DCAM API properties


APDManager
----------------

DetectorManager that deals with an avalanche photodiode connected to a counter input on a Nidaq card.

Available manager properties:

- terminal -- the physical input terminal on the Nidaq to which the APD is connected
- ctrInputLine -- the counter that the physical input terminal is connected to


TISManager
----------------

DetectorManager that deals with TheImagingSource cameras and the parameters for frame extraction from them.

Available manager properties:

- cameraListIndex -- the camera's index in the TIS camera list (list indexing starts at 0); set this string to an invalid value to load a mocker
- tis -- dictionary of TIS camera properties


Laser managers
==============

LantzLaserManager
-----------------------

LaserManager for lasers that are fully digitally controlled using
drivers available through Lantz.

Available manager properties:

- digitalDriver -- a string containing a Lantz driver name, e.g. "cobolt.cobolt0601.Cobolt0601"
- digitalPorts -- a string array containing the COM ports to connect to, e.g. ["COM4"]


NidaqAOLaserManager
-------------------

LaserManager for analog NI-DAQ-controlled lasers.

Available manager properties: None


AAAOTFLaserManager
-------------------

LaserManager for controlling one channel of an AA Opto-Electronic acousto-optic modulator/tunable filter through RS232 communication.

Available manager properties:

- rs232device -- name of the defined rs232 communication channel through which the communication should take place
- channel -- index of the channel in the acousto-optic device that should be controlled (indexing starts at 1)


KatanaLaserManager
-------------------

LaserManager for controlling a OneFive Katana pulsed laser (NKT Photonics).

Available manager properties:

- rs232device -- name of the defined rs232 communication channel through which the communication should take place 


Positioner managers
===================

NidaqPositionerManager
------------------------

PositionerManager for analog NI-DAQ-controlled positioners.

Available manager properties:

- conversionFactor -- float
- minVolt -- minimum voltage
- maxVolt -- maximum voltage


PiezoconceptZManager
------------------------

PositionerManager for control of a Piezoconcept Z-piezo through RS232-communication.

Available manager properties:

- rs232device -- name of the defined rs232 communication channel through which the communication should take place 


RS232 manager
=============

A general-purpose RS232 manager that together with a general-purpose RS232Driver interface can handle an arbitrary RS232 communication channel,
with all the standard serial communication protocol parameters as defined in the hardware control configuration. 

Available manager properties:

- port, encoding, recv_termination, send_termination, baudrate, bytesize, parity, stopbits, rtscts, dsrdtr, xonxoff


Misc. managers
==============

SLMManager
----------

A manager for that deals with a Hamamatsu SLM, connected with a video input connector.

Available manager properties:

- monitorIdx -- index of the monitor in a list of monitors from wxPython (indexing starts at 0)
- width -- width, in pixels, of SLM
- height -- height, in pixels, of SLM
- wavelength -- wavelength of the laser line used with the SLM
- pixelSize -- pixel size/pixel pitch, in mm, of the SLM
- angleMount -- the angle of incidence and reflection, in radians, of the laser line that is shaped by the SLM, for adding a blazed grating to create off-axis holography
- correctionPatternsDir -- directory of .bmp images provided by Hamamatsu for flatness correction at various wavelengths, a combination will be chosen based on the wavelength
