ImSwitch
********
ImSwitch is software in Python that aims at generalizing microscope control
by using an architecture based on the model-view-presenter (MVP) to provide 
a solution for flexible control of multiple microscope modalities.

In this documentation page you will find all information you need about the installation, usage and development of ImSwitch,
both from the user perspective (GUI description and use cases) as
well as for developers (scripting and API modules, and hardware control and JSON config files).
