Installation
*************

In general it is only needed to have a Python 3.8 environment with pip,
then install the requirements from a shell:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

We recommend having a designated environment, for example with conda:

``conda create -n imswitch python=3.8``

``conda activate imswitch``

``cd /path_of_imswitch``

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Then run ImSwitch by typing:

``python -m imswitch``
