Scripting
*********

ImSwitch provides a scripting module that can be used to automate tasks in the software. This
scripting module allows you to freely write Python code that interacts with ImSwitch.

See the scripting API reference for more information about the available API modules and methods.
Aside from the API modules, there are also some global-level functions that you can use, that are
documented here (TODO: link).

The API modules may provide signals â€“ events that can be bound to through e.g. the global
getWaitForSignal scripting function.

There are a few example scripts in the /scripts/examples/ directory that you can check out to see
how the scripting works in action.
