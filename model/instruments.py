    """This was originally (by federico) called from tormenta.py using a "with" call, as with the Lasers. But
    accoring to litterature, "with" should be used with classes having __enter__ and __exit functions defined. 
    For some reason this particular class gives "Error: class is missing __exit__ fcn" (or similar)
    Maybe it could be rewritten using __enter__  __exit__.

    Although I believe that design is more suitable for funcions that are 
    called alot or environments that are used alot."""
