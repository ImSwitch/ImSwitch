abstract = {Abstract With the advent of digital cameras and motorization of mechanical components, computer control of microscopes has become increasingly important. Software for microscope image acquisition should not only be easy to use, but also enable and encourage novel approaches. The open-source software package ÂµManager aims to fulfill those goals. This unit provides step-by-step protocols describing how to get started working with ÂµManager, as well as some starting points for advanced use of the software. Curr. Protoc. Mol.

	abstract = {Bespoke microscopes often require control of multiple hardware devices and precise hardware coordination. It is also desirable to have a control solution that is scalable to more complex systems and translatable between components from different manufacturers. Here we report Python-Microscope, a free and open source Python library for high performance control of arbitrarily complex and scalable bespoke microscopes. Python-Microscope offers an elegant pythonic software platform to control microscopes, abstracting differences between physical devices by providing a defined interface for different device types. These include cameras, filter wheels, light sources, deformable mirrors, and stages. Concrete implementations are provided for a range of specific hardware and a framework is in place for further expansion. Python-Microscope supports the distribution of devices over multiple computers while maintaining synchronisation via highly precise hardware triggers. We discuss the architecture choices of Python-Microscope that overcome the performance problems often raised against Python and demonstrate the different use cases that drove its design: its integration in user facing projects, namely in the Microscope-Cockpit project; in controlling complex microscopes at high speed while using the Python programming language; and as a microscope simulation tool for software development.Competing Interest StatementMartin J Booth declares a significant interest in Aurox Ltd., whose microscopes were used in this work.},

	abstract = {We have developed {\textquotedblleft}Microscope-Cockpit{\textquotedblright} (Cockpit), a highly adaptable open source user-friendly Python-based GUI environment for precision control of both simple and elaborate bespoke microscope systems. The user environment allows next-generation near-instantaneous navigation of the entire slide landscape for efficient selection of specimens of interest and automated acquisition without the use of eyepieces. Cockpit uses {\textquotedblleft}Python-Microscope{\textquotedblright} (Microscope) for high-performance coordinated control of a wide range of hardware devices using open source software. Microscope also controls complex hardware devices such as deformable mirrors for aberration correction and spatial light modulators for structured illumination via abstracted device models. We demonstrate the advantages of the Cockpit platform using several bespoke microscopes, including a simple widefield system and a complex system with adaptive optics and structured illumination. A key strength of Cockpit is its use of Python, which means that any microscope built with Cockpit is ready for future customisation by simply adding new libraries, for example machine learning algorithms to enable automated microscopy decision making while imaging.HighlightsUser-friendly setup and use for simple to complex bespoke microscopes.Facilitates collaborations between biomedical scientists and microscope technologists.Touchscreen for near-instantaneous navigation of specimen landscape.Uses Python-Microscope, for abstracted open source hardware device control.Well-suited for user training of AI-algorithms for automated microscopy.Competing Interest StatementMartin Booth declares a significant interest in Aurox Ltd., whose microscopes were used in this work.},
